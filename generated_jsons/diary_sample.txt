12:00 AM – 08:27 AM: I woke up in **Grove Hall (Roxbury)**, the hall’s quiet hum and the soft glow of the early light making the space feel like a personal sanctuary. The atmosphere was calm, and I could hear my own breathing as a gentle metronome for the day ahead.

11:09 AM – 11:42 AM: I dashed toward the train station, running through the streets of Fenway, heart racing.

Sign**, the modern **La Colombe Coffee Roasters**, and the cozy **Lolita**. Each stop felt like a chapter, loud and lively, yet I kept my focus on the path home.

02:18 PM – 02:48 PM: At **Snell Library** I settled in for another study session. The environment buzzed with quiet concentration; the occasional clatter of desks added to the low hum. I sat, absorbed, letting the library’s calm envelope me.

02:48 PM – 02:50 PM: A brief, hurried sprint carried me from Snell to **Ryder Hall (Fenway)**. I rushed past a **Subway** kiosk and a quick **Dunkin'** stop, the city’s rhythm thumping in my ears as I made my way to class.

02:50 PM – 04:45 PM: In **Ryder Hall**, the atmosphere was socially charged but personal and quiet at the same time. I walked into class, scrolling through messages on my phone, feeling the hum of the room as I took my seat.
