    "clue": "The loud but strangely quiet atmosphere at Northeastern created a sense of _______.",
    "score": 3,
    "reason": "The diary directly states a 'loud but strangely quiet atmosphere' at Northeastern. While 'opposition' isn't a perfect fit, the contrasting descriptors create a sense of internal conflict or duality which the clue hints at."

  },
  {
    "word": "PISTON",
    "clue": "Like a _______ in an engine, you were constantly moving between Snell Library and other locations today.",

  },
  {
    "word": "SOOT",
    "clue": "As the snow began to fall at 4:49 PM, a thin layer of _______ might have settled on the library windows.",
    "score": 3,
    "reason": "Contextually plausible, though slightly less direct. Snowfall could logically lead to soot-like deposits, especially on windows. The connection isn\u2019t *strong*, but isn\u2019t a hallucination."
  },
  {
    "word": "TONGS",
    "clue": "If you stopped at Pink Taco, you might need _______ to enjoy your meal.",
    "score": 3,

    "score": 3,
    "reason": "Moderately valid. The diary describes a lot of rushing and movement between locations, which could indicate an attempt to be productive. However, 'tiptop' feels a bit strong of a descriptor."
