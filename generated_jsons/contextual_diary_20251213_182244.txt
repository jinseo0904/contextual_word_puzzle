--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM - 8:27 AM, I woke up in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet morning, a peaceful start, though a little social – I could hear muffled chatter. I just stayed put, letting the calm settle in.

8:27 AM, I rushed out of Grove Hall, heading towards Snell Library in Fenway. I was cycling, trying to make good time, then sat for a moment catching my breath. I passed a string of spots – Subway, Dunkin’ – a familiar Boston scene.

8:54 AM, I quickly made my way *into* Snell Library. It was a hectic push to get settled before class, and I was already feeling rushed.

9:05 AM, Walking out of Snell Library, I headed towards Northeastern University, still in Fenway. I was distracted, glued to my screen as I walked, completely missing things. I passed Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, another Dunkin’, Burger 373 – so many choices, but I barely registered them. 

9:07 AM - 10:17 AM, I sat down at Northeastern University, trying to repeat course material, but the environment was loud and social, almost chaotic. I was sitting, trying to focus, but the noise kept pulling me away.

10:17 AM, I quickly hurried back to Snell Library, passing Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, and Burger 373 again. I was focused on reaching my destination, barely noticing anything around me. 

10:20 AM - 11:09 AM, Back at Snell Library, I sat down, trying to concentrate on my work, though it was still a bit noisy.

11:09 AM, I was running to catch the train at Snell Library, aiming for Amazon Boston in Seaport. I wrote the subway and walked to the office. I passed so many places on the way– Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald's, Boston Back Bay, Melting Sun, Dunkin', Master Wok, Argo Tea, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Boston South Station, Auntie Anne's, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, Back Bay, Row 34, Caffé Strega – it was a blur of city life.

11:42 AM - 1:51 PM, I walked to my friend’s office in Amazon Boston, Seaport, then sat waiting in the lobby. I was sitting down, then walked to the bathroom, but I had a strange feeling, like my mind had aged. 

1:51 PM, Walking back to school from Seaport, I sat on the train. I passed Dunkin’, Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Boston Back Bay, Boston Back Bay, Auntie Anne's, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, Lolita – another whirlwind of sights.

2:18 PM - 2:48 PM, I sat back down at Snell Library. It was busy, noisy, but I tried to block it out and focus on my work.

2:48 PM, I hurried over to Ryder Hall, passing Subway and Dunkin' again.

2:50 PM - 4:45 PM, I walked into class at Ryder Hall, sat down, and started taking notes. I spent a while sitting, then walking around.

4:45 PM, I hurried back to Snell Library, passing the Subway.

4:49 PM - 9:21 PM, I craved being back at Snell Library, so I just sat down. I sat taking course after course, and walked to the bathroom. I was sitting down taking classes, and then sitting down again. I opened the door standing. I was sitting down doing homework, working on assignments, and simply walking around the library.

9:21 PM, I left Snell Library and made my way back to Grove Hall, passing ilona, Kura Sushi, ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, Farmer Horse Coffee, Ruggles, Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee's, and finally reaching Uphams Corner.

9:45 PM - 11:59 PM, Back in Grove Hall, I just stood around, watching everything. It was a strange mix of quiet and loud, social and peaceful. And then, it was time for bed.
