--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM – 8:27 AM found me waking up in Grove Hall (Roxbury). It was quiet, a peaceful start to the day, though there was a definite social buzz in the air. I just felt…still waking up.

At 8:27 AM, I rushed out of Grove Hall (Roxbury) and headed towards Snell Library (Fenway). I was cycling, sitting on the bike, and passed a string of places – Subway and Dunkin’ were early morning staples. 

By 8:54 AM, I was inside Snell Library (Fenway), immediately getting to work. It was a high-exertion scramble, trying to get settled before class. I was walking, leaving Snell Library, and then I was back to the books.

At 9:05 AM, I continued my walk from Snell Library (Fenway) to Northeastern University (Fenway). I passed Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, Dunkin', and Burger 373 along the way. I was distracted by my phone, rushing to get there on time, my eyes glued to the screen.

9:07 AM – 10:17 AM was spent at Northeastern University (Fenway). It was a loud but strangely quiet atmosphere, social but also requiring focus. I sat down, repeating course material, trying to get it to stick. Just…sitting.

At 10:17 AM, I hurried back from Northeastern University (Fenway) to Snell Library (Fenway). I passed Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill's, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, and Chaat House. 

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM found me sitting in Snell Library (Fenway), quietly studying.

Then, at 11:09 AM, I was rushing again, from Snell Library (Fenway) all the way to Amazon Boston (Seaport)! I ran to the train station, scribbling on my phone, writing notes about the Subway as I went. The city whizzed by—Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald's, Boston Back Bay, Melting Sun, Dunkin', Master Wok, Argo Tea, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Boston South Station, Auntie Anne's, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, Back Bay, Row 34, Caffé Strega. 

I spent the time from 11:42 AM – 1:51 PM walking to my friend's office in Amazon Boston (Seaport), and then waiting in the lobby. I was just sitting there, and then walking to the bathroom… It’s weird, I felt older, like something had shifted. 

By 1:51 PM, I was headed back to Snell Library (Fenway) from Amazon Boston (Seaport). The train was packed, and I was glued to my phone, trying to distract myself. I passed Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Boston Back Bay, Boston Back Bay, Auntie Anne's, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, Lolita.

2:18 PM – 2:48 PM was a quiet spell back in Snell Library (Fenway), just sitting.

At 2:48 PM, I hurried from Snell Library (Fenway) to Ryder Hall (Fenway), passing Subway and Dunkin' once more.

From 2:50 PM – 4:45 PM, I was in Ryder Hall (Fenway) – walking in, then sitting down for class. 

4:45 PM saw me rushing back to Snell Library (Fenway), just passing the Subway.

I stayed at Snell Library (Fenway) from 4:49 PM – 9:21 PM. I craved being back in the library, just sat there and took course, walked to the bathroom, and sat down again. I was taking class, then sitting down. I sat, taking class in the library, even as the snow started to fall. It was a peaceful hum.

At 9:21 PM, I left Snell Library (Fenway) and headed back to Grove Hall (Roxbury). I passed ilona, Kura Sushi, ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, Farmer Horse Coffee, Ruggles, Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee's, and finally, Uphams Corner. 

I spent the last hours of the day, from 9:45 PM – 11:59 PM, in Grove Hall (Roxbury), standing and sitting. The night was loud, busy, but strangely calming.
