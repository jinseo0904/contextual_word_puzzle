--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM - 08:27 AM – Woke up this morning in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet start to the day, a peaceful atmosphere while I gathered myself. 

08:27 AM – Left Grove Hall and hurried towards Snell Library in Fenway. I cycled, then sat for a moment catching my breath. Passed a string of spots like Dunkin' and even spotted the Subway along the way.

08:54 AM – Made it to Snell Library, immediately feeling the pressure – it was a rush just getting inside! I was walking to class, leaving Snell, already feeling the day pick up pace.

09:05 AM – Still rushing, I walked from Snell Library to Northeastern University in Fenway, glued to my screen as I navigated. So many places along the way: Argo Tea, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, another Dunkin', Burger 373… it was a blur. 

09:07 AM – Arrived at Northeastern, sat down to repeat some course material, trying to stay focused even with the loud environment. It was a bit of a social atmosphere, actually.

Sign, Back Bay, Row 34, and Caffé Strega.

11:42 PM – Finally arrived at Amazon Boston in Seaport. I walked to my friend’s office then sat in the lobby waiting. It was a quiet atmosphere, yet I felt like my mind was changing, getting older.

04:45 PM – Class finished, I hurried back to Snell Library. Passed the Subway once more.

04:49 PM – Back at Snell Library, I sat down, craving being back in the library. I sat taking course, walking to the bathroom. I was taking class in the library, sitting down patient in the snow. Now, I'm sitting down doing homework, taking assignments. I’m walking in the library.
