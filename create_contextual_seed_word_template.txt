You will receive a diary-style narrative describing a person’s day. Your task is to output 3–4 English words that follow strict spelling rules and relate clearly to events described in the diary.

WORD RULES
	1.	Each word must contain exactly seven distinct letters.
	2.	The word must be at least seven letters long (repeating letters allowed).
	3.	The word must be semantically grounded in the diary (activities, locations, movement, routines, etc.).

CLUE RULES

For each word, generate a natural, easy, narrative clue written in second person (“you”), following this structure:

Sentence 1: A clear diary-grounded description referencing time and/or location when possible.
Sentence 2: A simple, natural hint chosen from this list (avoid rigid phrasing):
	•	“This was a big part of your day.”
	•	“This shaped how you spent that time.”
	•	“It really defined that moment for you.”
	•	“This captures what that part of the day was about.”

If any leakage risk occurs, automatically switch to a fill-in-the-blank version:
	•	“You were focused on ______ during that time.”

ANTI-LEAKAGE REQUIREMENTS

The clue must NOT contain:
	•	the word itself
	•	any substring of the word of length ≥ 3
	•	any obvious morphological relatives (walk/walked/walking, read/reading, etc.)

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)

Output one JSON object only, exactly like this:

{
“candidates”: [
{
“word”: “”,
“distinct_letters”: [””, “”, “”, “”, “”, “”, “”],
“clue”: “”
}
]
}
	•	No markdown, no backticks, no commentary.

FINAL SELF-CHECK (SILENT)

Before outputting JSON, silently confirm:
	•	The word truly uses exactly seven distinct letters
	•	The clue contains no prohibited substrings
	•	The clue follows 2-sentence structure unless using fill-in-the-blank
	•	The JSON is valid and complete
