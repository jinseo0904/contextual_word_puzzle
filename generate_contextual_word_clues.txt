You are helping design an easy word game based on a person’s real day. Players will see a narrative summary of their day and a set of candidate words. Your job is to:
	1.	Select only the words that are clearly related to the day, and
	2.	Create very easy, fill-in-the-blank clues for those words, and
	3.	Explain, in plain language, why each word is related to the day.

====================
INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE

You will be given:
	1.	A narrative movement summary of the day, written in the first person, describing:

	•	Where the person started,
	•	Where they went (locations, buildings, neighborhoods, cities),
	•	Approximately when they moved (times),
	•	Any notable places they passed (cafés, restaurants, transit stations, etc.).

	2.	A list of candidate words (lowercase, no definitions provided).

Use only the information given in these two inputs.

====================
YOUR TASK

Given the day summary and the word list:
	1.	Carefully read the movement summary and identify all words from the list that have a clear, direct, concrete, or very easy-to-explain connection to the day. The connection can be:

	•	A specific place mentioned in the summary (e.g., home, library, Seaport, campus),
	•	A specific movement between places (e.g., returning from Seaport at 2 PM),
	•	A specific time tied to an event (e.g., arriving at Ryder Hall at 2:50 PM),
	•	A concrete object repeatedly encountered (e.g., coffee, sugar, trains),
	•	A simple emotional or descriptive reaction (e.g., a “nice” break from campus).

Do NOT select words if the connection is abstract, metaphorical, symbolic, or requires stretching the interpretation. If you cannot tie the word to one specific real moment in the day, drop it.
	2.	For each selected word, create a VERY EASY clue:

	•	Make it fill-in-the-blank when possible.
	•	Tie it directly to one concrete moment, place, or detail from the summary.
	•	The clue should be obvious to someone who just read their own day summary.
	•	The clues must be easier than typical crossword clues.
	•	Avoid archaic language, and avoid metaphorical or difficult phrasing.
	•	If the word is rare or old-fashioned but still usable, make the clue extremely obvious (e.g., “a fancier old word for drinking”).

	3.	For each selected word, write a short reasoning explanation (1–3 sentences) explaining exactly which part of the day you tied the word to and why the word makes sense.

====================
STYLE AND CLUE GUIDELINES
	•	Difficulty should come from remembering the day, not from solving vocabulary puzzles.
	•	Prefer clues tied to a single instance (a single movement, a single café, a specific time, etc.).
	•	If the word is too obscure or cannot be cleanly grounded in the day, do not select it.
	•	Avoid symbolic or abstract interpretations.
	•	Do not pick any word just because you can force a justification.

====================
EXAMPLES OF GOOD OUTPUT STYLE

Example for the word “been”:
Clue: “I have ______ to Ryder Hall at 2:50 PM.”
Reasoning: The summary explicitly mentions arriving at Ryder Hall at 2:50 PM.

Example for the word “came”:
Clue: “I ______ back from the Seaport around 2 PM.”
Reasoning: The summary says the person returned from the Seaport in the early afternoon.

Example for the word “became”:
Clue: “Snell Library ______ your home base today.”
Reasoning: The summary shows repeated returns to Snell, so it became their home base.

Example for the word “mine”:
Clue: “Unlike anything on campus, everything at 3 Hartford Street is ______.”
Reasoning: 3 Hartford Street is their home, so everything there is “mine.”

Example for the word “bean”:
Clue: “Inside every Dunkin’ and Starbucks you passed today is the coffee ______.”
Reasoning: The person walked past multiple coffee shops, which revolve around coffee beans.

If a word cannot be tied to a specific place, time, or object from the day summary, drop it.

====================
OUTPUT FORMAT

Return your answer as JSON with the following structure:

{
“selected_words”: [
{
“word”: “WORD_HERE”,
“clue”: “FILL-IN-THE-BLANK CLUE HERE”,
“reasoning”: “Explanation here.”
}
]
}

Do NOT include words you did not select. Do NOT invent new words.
