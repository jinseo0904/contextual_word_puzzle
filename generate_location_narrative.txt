Your task is to write a natural, flowing, diary-style narrative describing a person’s day, based entirely on the structured movement summary and POI data provided. The goal is to transform the raw movements, stays, times, and nearby places into a smooth, readable journal entry that feels personal, reflective, and human.

====================
WHAT YOU MUST DO
	1.	Write the output in the first person (“I”).
	2.	Create a narrative that feels like someone recounting their day in a journal.
	3.	Mention each major movement:
	•	where they started,
	•	where they went,
	•	what time they moved,
	•	and how long they stayed.
	4.	Integrate POIs in a subtle, contextual way:
	•	Only mention POIs that a person would realistically notice while passing by.
	•	You do NOT need to list all POIs.
	•	You may group similar POIs (e.g., “passed multiple coffee shops like Dunkin’ and Starbucks”).
	5.	Avoid sounding like a timeline or a report. Make it read smoothly.
	6.	Include small reflective comments to make it feel like a real diary (e.g., noticing the weather, the feeling of switching locations, the contrast between places).
	7.	Keep the narrative grounded strictly in the provided data. Do not invent trips that did not occur.
	8.	If a location is visited multiple times (ex: Snell Library), acknowledge that it becomes a sort of “home base.”
	9.	Smoothly transition between time blocks so it feels like natural storytelling.
	10.	The tone should be casual, descriptive, and easy to read.

====================
STYLE GUIDELINES
	•	Do NOT list times mechanically. They should appear naturally.
	•	You may paraphrase time ranges as “late morning,” “early afternoon,” etc., but keep them consistent with the real times.
	•	Mention places naturally (“I headed over to the Seaport next” instead of “Movement: C1 to C3”).
	•	Use the distances and POIs only to add texture or context.
	•	Avoid robotic phrasing or technical words like “cluster,” “transition,” or “stayed for 49.0 minutes.”
	•	Do NOT over-describe POIs. One mention per path is enough.

====================
GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE TONE

“I started my morning at home in Grove Hall, slowly getting ready before stepping outside around 8:30 AM. The walk toward campus brought me past the usual fast-food spots near Roxbury, those places that seem permanently busy in the morning. By the time I reached Snell Library, I had fully woken up.”

“When I headed to Northeastern’s main campus a little after nine, it was barely a two-minute walk—just enough time to pass Argo Tea and the other student-center fast food places.”

“Going to the Seaport felt like a complete change of scenery. The trip took me through Back Bay and South Station, all the familiar commuter landmarks.”

This is the level of natural flow you should aim for.

====================
INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE

You will be given two major sections:
	1.	POIs along transitions:
	•	A list of nearby places along each path between two locations.
	•	You should only use these to add light context, not to list them all.
	2.	Narrative summary:
	•	A structured list of stays (location + duration + times).
	•	A structured list of movements (origin + destination + times + distances).

Use both sections to reconstruct a coherent day.

====================
OUTPUT

Your output should be a single, continuous, narrative-style journal entry, written in the first person, describing the entire day from beginning to end.

No bullet points. No lists. No headings.
Just a smooth, readable diary entry.

====================
NOW USE THIS ON THE ACTUAL INPUT

POIs along transitions:
<<<POI_DATA>>>

Narrative summary:
<<<MOVEMENT_SUMMARY>>>

IMPORTANT RULES — DO NOT VIOLATE THESE:
	1.	Do NOT invent details that are not supported by the data.
	•	Do NOT assume when the person woke up.
	•	Do NOT invent feelings, weather, errands, tasks, interactions, or anything that is not guaranteed by the timestamps and movements.
	•	You may add general tone and reflection, but no fictional events or facts.
	2.	Clusters represent geographic areas, NOT specific buildings.
	•	Never state that the person was inside the exact POI that names the cluster.
	•	Instead of “I stayed at Amazon Boston,” say:
	•	“I stayed in the Seaport area near the Amazon building,” or
	•	“I was around the Seaport area near that big Amazon office.”
	•	Instead of “I was at Snell Library,” say:
	•	“I was in the Snell Library area on campus.”
	3.	For every location cluster, always phrase it as:
	•	“in the area around ___”
	•	“near ___”
	•	“around the ___ neighborhood”
	•	“in the vicinity of ___”
unless the narrative summary explicitly confirms something stronger.
	4.	Do NOT invent intentions or purposes (e.g., “I went to grab coffee,” “I went to study,” “I met someone”).
	•	You may say neutral things like “I spent time there,” “I settled in for a bit,” etc.
	5.	The only assumptions allowed are:
	•	Natural language smoothing (e.g., “It was a short walk,” “I made my way back”).
	•	Light, non-factual reflective comments that do not invent events (e.g., “It felt like I was back and forth a lot today,” “It was a long stretch of time in that area”).
	•	Observational comments based only on POIs visible along the path (e.g., “I passed multiple cafés like Dunkin’ and Starbucks”).

Follow all previous instructions, but ALWAYS obey rules 1–5 above. Write the diary entry now.
