Your task is to write a natural, flowing, diary-style narrative describing a person’s day, based entirely on:

• A structured movement summary
• POIs along each movement path
• uEMA self-reports (labels or short transcripts)

Your job is to turn these into a single, smooth first-person journal entry, grounded ONLY in the given data, with no invented facts.

====================
CORE REQUIREMENTS
	1.	Write in the first person (“I”).
	2.	Do not assume anything that is not explicitly stated.
	•	Do NOT assume when I woke up.
	•	Do NOT assume specific activities like studying, homework, classes, errands, or office visits unless the self-report literally says so.
	3.	Clusters represent geographic areas, not buildings.
	•	Say “in the Snell Library area,” not “in Snell Library.”
	•	Say “in the Seaport area near the Amazon building,” not “at Amazon Boston.”
	4.	Narrative must cover all major movements (origin → destination → general timing → how long I stayed).
	5.	Use POIs whenever naturally possible to give environmental texture.
	•	Mention 1–3 POIs per movement path if they are realistic walk-by observations.
	•	Group them: “I passed a few fast-food spots like Dunkin’ and McDonald’s.”
	6.	Use uEMA self-reports sparingly and naturally.
	•	Self-reports may be incorrectly transcribed (e.g., “writing Subway” may mean “riding subway”).
	•	You may correct obvious ASR errors only if the correction is unambiguous and consistent with movement.
	•	If not clear, quote it literally and neutrally (“I recorded something like ‘writing Subway’ around then”).
	•	A self-report describes only that moment, not an extended block of time.
	•	You may turn labels into natural sentences (“I was sitting for a bit”).
	7.	Never list long chains of timestamps.
	•	Summarize them (“I recorded myself sitting several times over the late morning”).
	8.	Tone should be simple, reflective, human, and NOT a timeline or logbook.
	9.	Never fabricate feelings, thoughts, or experiences.
	•	Light, generic reflections like “It felt like a lot of back-and-forth” are allowed.

====================
HOW TO USE SELF-REPORTS

uEMA entries should:

• Add light hints of activity when they align with place/time.
• Never override movement data.
• Never imply intentions, tasks, or routines not stated.

Correct usage examples:
	•	Label “Sitting” during a stay near Snell Library →
“While I was in the Snell Library area, I remember sitting for a bit.”
	•	Transcript “I’m walking into the class” →
“At one point I recorded, ‘I’m walking into the class,’ as I was moving across campus.”
	•	Transcript with clear ASR error “I’m writing Subway” while traveling toward Seaport:
“The transcript showed something like ‘I’m writing Subway,’ which I took to mean riding the subway as I headed toward the Seaport area.”

Self-reports should never:

• Be repeated verbatim for every timestamp
• Produce invented narratives (“I spent hours taking classes,” “I was doing homework”)
• Infer long activity blocks based on repeated “Sitting” labels
• Imply entering buildings that are not guaranteed

====================
POI INTEGRATION RULES

Encourage POI usage:

• Try to incorporate POIs meaningfully for every movement.
• Use them as environmental details you noticed while walking.
• Never list them mechanically.
• Mention only what feels human: cafés, restaurants, stations, landmarks, etc.

Correct examples:
	•	“On my way toward the Seaport area, I passed places like Au Bon Pain, Dunkin’, and McDonald’s.”
	•	“Walking back toward campus, I moved past a few familiar spots near Back Bay station.”
