You are helping design short, smartwatch-friendly ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questions that will ALSO serve as “priming” for a later word game.

We have a list of words. For each word, your job is to decide whether it is suitable for a small, concrete, behavior-related EMA question. If it is, you must generate:
	1.	A very short EMA question (3–4 words max) that fits on a smartwatch screen.
	2.	3–4 multiple-choice options the user can tap.
	3.	A generic word-game clue.
	4.	Response-dependent clues: one separate clue for EACH answer option, that explicitly references the user’s answer and makes the word extremely easy to guess later.

If the word is too obscure, technical, archaic, or hard to tie to a concrete behavior, mark it as unusable and skip question/clue generation.

The EMA questions must be about concrete, real-life constructs, and NOT abstract philosophy. Keep them in the following domains ONLY:
	•	Activities (what they did)
	•	Daily routines (sleep, getting ready, commuting, etc.)
	•	Habits (study habits, phone use, cooking, etc.)
	•	Socialization / relationships (friends, family, romantic, pets)
	•	Personality-related behavior (e.g., “did anyone annoy you?”, “were you kind?”)
	•	Diet / eating habits (what they ate/drank, caffeine, sweets, etc.)
	•	Physical activity / sports / movement
	•	Simple daily environment exposure (e.g., cold, bright light) IF tied to behavior

Do NOT ask abstract introspection questions like “What are your values?” This system is meant to be answered quickly on a watch.

====================
TASK SUMMARY

For each word:
	1.	Decide if it is “usable” for a simple, behavior-related EMA question.
	2.	If usable, choose ONE construct from the list above and write:
	•	A 3–4 word EMA question
	•	3–4 short multiple-choice options
	•	A generic clue
	•	A response-specific clue for EACH option
	3.	If not usable, mark it as unusable and explain briefly why (e.g., “too archaic,” “chemical term,” “no natural behavioral mapping”).

The EMA question and options must make sense on their own without the word game context.

====================
DETAILED RULES
	1.	EMA QUESTION

	•	Maximum 4 words (ideally 2–4).
	•	Must clearly fit one of these constructs: activity, routine, habit, socialization, personality-related behavior, diet, physical activity, or simple daily environment.
	•	Must be understandable on its own.
	•	Should NOT include the target word in the question text (but the word MAY appear as one of the answer options if appropriate).

Examples of good EMA questions:
	•	“How’s your day?”
	•	“Drink coffee today?”
	•	“See dogs today?”
	•	“Cold outside?”
	•	“Eat sweets?”
	•	“Talk to anyone?”
	•	“Sleep hours?”

	2.	OPTIONS

	•	3 or 4 options per question.
	•	Each option must be short (1–2 words).
	•	Options should be behaviorally meaningful and realistic.
	•	It is allowed (but not required) for the target word to be one of the options, if it makes sense and is fun.
	•	Options should be mutually exclusive and collectively reasonable.

Examples:
	•	For “How’s your day?” → [“Bad”, “Okay”, “Nice”, “Great”]
	•	For “Drink coffee today?” → [“Yes”, “No”, “Decaf”]
	•	For “See dogs today?” → [“Yes”, “No”, “On screen”]

	3.	GENERIC CLUE

	•	A short sentence referring to the earlier EMA question.
	•	It should mention that the user answered that question earlier in the day.
	•	It should strongly hint at the target word, but still be worded like a friendly reminder.

Example generic clue for the word “nice”:
	•	“This afternoon, you described your day. You said it felt pretty ______.”

	4.	RESPONSE-DEPENDENT CLUES

	•	You must give a distinct clue for EACH answer option.
	•	Each clue should explicitly reference what the user chose.
	•	Clues must make the target word extremely easy to guess.
	•	They should be playful, concrete, and NON-cryptic.

The structure:
	•	“If user selects OPTION_A: CLUE_TEXT”
	•	“If user selects OPTION_B: CLUE_TEXT”
	•	etc.

Examples for the word “iceman”, question “Cold outside?”, options [“Yes”, “No”, “A little”]:
	•	If “Yes”: “You said it was cold outside. Stay out too long and you’ll turn into an ______.”
	•	If “No”: “You said it wasn’t cold at all today. No risk of becoming an ______.”
	•	If “A little”: “You said it was a little cold. Not quite enough to freeze you into an ______.”

Examples for the word “nice”, question “How’s your day?”, options [“Bad”, “Okay”, “Nice”, “Great”]:
	•	If “Bad”: “You said your day was bad. Hopefully it turns ______ tomorrow.”
	•	If “Okay”: “You said your day was just okay. Not terrible, not yet ______.”
	•	If “Nice”: “You literally said your day was ______. Easiest puzzle ever.”
	•	If “Great”: “You said your day was great — even better than just ______.”

	5.	USABILITY DECISION

	•	Some words are not suitable:
	•	too rare or archaic,
	•	strongly technical/chemical,
	•	religious/theological terms,
	•	or too abstract to link naturally to behavior.
	•	For these, do NOT force a question.
	•	Mark them as usable = false and give a short reason.
