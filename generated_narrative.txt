Woke up around 8:20 AM and started my day. Shortly after 8:25 AM, I headed toward the Fenway area, noting that I was cycling part of the way. Arrived at Snell Library around 8:55 AM, standing as I got settled. Left Snell Library around 9:05 AM, walking toward Northeastern University. It was a quick trip, arriving around 9:07 AM and sitting down to repeat course material. I stayed there for about an hour, repeatedly recording that I was sitting. 

Around 10:20 AM, I walked back to Snell Library. Spent another 45 minutes or so there, sitting and continuing to work. Around 11:10 AM, I was running to get to the train station. Rode the subway toward the Seaport area, arriving around 11:40 AM and recording that I was visiting a friend's office. Spent the next hour or so sitting and waiting for my friend in the lobby. Continued sitting, as I waited—it was good to have the time to just *be*. 

Around 1:50 PM, I started walking back toward the Fenway area. Rode the subway again, and around 2:10 PM, I was sitting on the train going back to school. Arrived back at Snell Library around 2:30 PM, then walked to Ryder Hall. I sat in class for a couple of hours. 

Around 4:45 PM, I walked back toward Snell Library, sitting down and craving to be back in the library. I stayed for a long stretch—nearly five hours—repeatedly recording that I was taking classes. I sat, and sat, and sat—time seems to slip away when I’m focused. 

Around 9:20 PM, I started walking toward Grove Hall, noting that I was opening a door and standing. I sat down, and sat down, and began working on assignments. I sat, recording that I was sitting, around 9:45 PM and stayed until roughly 10:00 PM. I sat, and sat, and sat—a lot of sitting today. I walked in the library, and then sat again. Eventually, around 11:00 PM, I was sitting down, and finally called it a night.
