I woke up this morning and after a bit, I was cycling and getting ready to head out. I ended up staying at Grove Hall for quite a while, nearly eight and a half hours. Eventually, I left around 8:27 AM, making my way towards Snell Library. I was standing in the library briefly, then walking to class just after 9:00 AM. I sat down to repeat some course material, and stayed seated for quite a while, lost in thought. 

Around 11:00 AM, I was running to catch the train, heading towards the Seaport. I was writing a message about taking the subway, then walking to a friend’s office in the Seaport area. I was walking to my friend’s office, and then sitting in the lobby waiting for them. I spent a couple of hours there, mostly sitting and waiting. 

Around 1:50 PM I started walking back towards school. I was on the train and then I was walking back to school, and eventually made it back to Snell Library around 2:18 PM. I didn’t stay long, though, just a quick stop before walking over to Ryder Hall. It was a short walk, only a couple of minutes. I stayed at Ryder Hall for a while, and then walked back towards Snell Library again. 

Back at Snell, I really craved being back in the library and sat down. I spent a huge chunk of the afternoon and evening there, taking classes and doing homework. I made a couple of trips to the bathroom, and took a few breaks to just sit and think. I was really focused on my coursework, just sitting and taking it all in. There was a lot of sitting, honestly! I was taking classes, opening doors, and then sitting some more. 

As the evening wore on, I walked around the library a bit and continued to work. Around 9:21 PM, I started heading back towards Grove Hall. I was walking again and eventually got back around 9:45 PM. I settled in for a bit before calling it a night, finally getting to bed around 11:59 PM. It was a long day full of a lot of walking, a lot of sitting, and a lot of studying!
