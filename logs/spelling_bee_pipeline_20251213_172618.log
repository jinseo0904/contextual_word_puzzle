--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM – 8:27 AM. Woke up in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet morning, a peaceful start to the day. Just easing into things.

8:27 AM. Suddenly, I needed to move. I hurried out of Grove Hall, cycling towards Snell Library in Fenway. Passed by a Dunkin' and the subway along the way. It was a bit of a rush, but I managed to get there before class.

8:54 AM. Got into Snell Library quickly, needing to get settled. I was walking to class, leaving Snell Library, and ended up passing by a ton of places: Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, and even another Dunkin' and Burger 373.

9:05 AM. Still rushing to class, from Snell Library to Northeastern University in Fenway. I was glued to my screen, totally distracted, and power-walking. So many places around – more Dunkin’, but also a glimpse of the Boston Wharf Co. Sign, then Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, Chaat House, and even Row 34.

9:07 AM – 10:17 AM. Finally made it to class at Northeastern University. I sat down and tried to repeat the course material. It was a fairly loud environment, though pockets of quiet existed. 

10:17 AM. Had to rush back to Snell Library. I was focused on getting there, passing Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill's and even Lolita.

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM. Back at Snell Library, I sat down and tried to focus. It was quiet, though you could hear movement around me.

11:09 AM. Needed to get to Seaport. I was running towards the train station, then writing the subway to get to Seaport. Passed by Boston South Station, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, another Dunkin', Master Wok, and more. A quick glance at the Boston Wharf Co. Sign reminded me where I was headed. 

11:42 AM – 1:51 PM. Arrived at Amazon Boston in Seaport, and walked to my friend’s office. It was busy in the lobby, so I sat down and waited. I even walked to the bathroom, thinking about how things have changed. My mind feels older somehow.

1:51 PM. Time to head back to school. I was rushing again, sitting on the train back from Seaport. Passed Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco,
