--- GENERATING DIARY (gpt-oss:20b) ---

12:00 AM – 08:27 AM – I was still curled up in the peaceful hush of Grove Hall (Roxbury). The quiet atmosphere let me drift into a soft dream, then I finally woke up, feeling the morning calm seep into the room.  

08:27 AM – 08:54 AM – I hopped on my bike and power‑walked out of Grove Hall, the soft thud of wheels echoing as I passed a Subway and a Dunkin' on the way to Snell Library (Fenway). The streets were busy, but the rush of commuters didn’t dampen my resolve to get to class.  

08:54 AM – 09:05 AM – I stood in the bustling library, the room filled with the noise of classmates. I hurried, clutching my notebook, and then left Snell Library heading toward Northeastern University (Fenway).  

09:05 AM – 09:07 AM – I sprinted across campus, scrolling through my phone while I made a quick stop at Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, and Dunkin'—the crowds and my phone glued to my screen made this a frantic dash to my lecture.  

09:07 AM – 10:17 AM – Back at Northeastern University, I settled into a quiet, though oddly loud, lecture hall and sat down, repeating the course material over and over, my mind both focused and buzzing with classmates’ chatter.  

10:17 AM – 10:20 AM – With the lecture over, I hurried back to Snell Library, watching the crowds as I passed by Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill’s, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, and Chaat House—each stop a bright blip on my route.  

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM – I lingered in the calm of Snell Library, gliding through the quiet as I stared at the shelves and people. I sat in silence, the library’s quiet letting me refocus after the rush.  

11:09 AM – 11:42 AM – The train station called, and I ran toward it, my phone in one hand, the other clutching my bag. I passed Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, Dunkin', Master Wok, Argo Tea, Pink Taco, Auntie Anne’s, and even caught sight of the iconic Boston Wharf Co. Sign. The rush was real, but the social atmosphere of the station kept me moving.  

11:42 AM – 01:51 PM – I arrived at Amazon Boston (Seaport) and sat in the quiet lobby, waiting for my friend. I walked to the bathroom, but my mind had shifted—an older version of myself, more patient and reflective.  

01:51 PM – 02:18 PM – I hurried back to campus, sliding through the noisy crowds and the clatter of the subway, again noticing Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Back Bay, Auntie Anne’s, Caffè Nero, Sportello, the Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, and Lolita—each a tiny beacon guiding my path.  

02:18 PM – 02:48 PM – I returned to Snell Library, where the quiet was again calm but the surrounding bustle still buzzed. I sat there, quietly observing the world around me.  

02:48 PM – 02:50 PM – In a rush, I hurried over to Ryder Hall (Fenway), hearing the clack of my shoes on the pavement and feeling the weight of my phone as I scrolled through messages.  

02:50 PM – 04:45 PM – Inside Ryder Hall, I walked into class with a distracted mind, still glued to my phone, yet the quiet of the hall steadied my focus. I sat, then walked back and forth, all while my thoughts flickered between lectures and notifications.  

04:45 PM – 04:49 PM – I rushed back to Snell Library, watching the crowds with my eyes peeled for the next opportunity to catch a glance at the subway.  

04:49 PM – 09:21 PM – In the quiet and social atmosphere of Snell Library, I sat for hours, taking class, reading, and simply being. My notes, the clatter of keyboards, and the occasional shout from a distant student kept the environment lively but never overwhelming.  

09:21 PM – 09:45 PM – I walked back to Grove Hall, noticing ilona, Kura Sushi, the ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, Farmer Horse Coffee, Ruggles, Caffè Bene, MIDA, Applebee’s, and Uphams Corner along the way—each stop adding a layer of flavor to my evening.  

09:45 PM – 11:59 PM – Back in Grove Hall, I stood in a focused, quiet environment, my mind a mix of calm and the buzz of a late‑night crowd. The quietness of the hall made the surrounding noise feel like a distant hum, but I still felt the pulse of the city around me.
