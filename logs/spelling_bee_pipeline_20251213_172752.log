--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM - 8:27 AM. Woke up this morning in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was quiet, a peaceful start to the day, though a little bit of a social buzz was already starting. Just easing into things.

8:27 AM. I hurried out of Grove Hall, making my way towards Snell Library in Fenway. Passed a string of spots – a Dunkin’ and Subway were right there. I was cycling and then sitting for a moment to collect myself. 

8:54 AM. Arrived at Snell Library, and it was immediately a rush! Getting inside was hectic. I was walking to class, leaving Snell Library.

9:05 AM. Still rushing, I power-walked from Snell Library to Northeastern University, also in Fenway. So many places to see – Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, even the Boston Globe Library, alongside the usual Dunkin’ and Burger 373. I was glued to my screen, completely distracted.

9:07 AM - 10:17 AM. Settled down at Northeastern University, repeating course material. It was a loud environment, strangely, but there was still a social energy. I sat for a long time, just…sitting.

10:17 AM. Needed to get back, so I hurried from Northeastern University back to Snell Library, passing Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, and Burger 373 again. I was really focused on getting back, watching the crowds carefully.

10:20 AM - 11:09 AM. Back at Snell Library, I sat down, trying to focus. It was a quiet atmosphere, though there was some movement around me. Just…sitting.

11:09 AM. Then it was a mad dash again! Rushing from Snell Library to Amazon Boston in Seaport. I was running to the train station and writing a subway to go to Seaport. I walked to my friend's office, passing Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, and Ruggles. I saw Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Dunkin', Master Wok, and Ruggles. There was even a glimpse of the Boston Wharf Co. Sign. I was so distracted, scrolling on my phone the whole time.

11:42 PM - 1:51 PM. Arrived at Amazon Boston, walking to my friend's office in Seaport. I waited in the lobby, then sat for a long time. It was surprisingly quiet, but still a social atmosphere. I walked to the bathroom, but something felt off… my mind felt older. 

1:51 PM. Time to head back to Snell Library from Amazon Boston. I was sitting on the train, but still rushing. I passed Dunkin’ and Au Bon Pain again, Boston South Station, Master Wok, and Ruggles. Saw Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald's, and Melting Sun. There was Row 34, and Boston Back Bay. And Auntie Anne’s, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, and Sportello. Another glimpse of Ruggles and Boston Wharf Co. Sign, then Lolita and La Colombe Coffee Roasters.

2:18 PM - 2:48 PM. Back at Snell Library, and I settled back into a seat. There was a lot of movement and noise, but I tried to ignore it. Just…sitting.

2:48 PM. I hurried from Snell Library to Ryder Hall. Passed Subway and Dunkin' again.

2:50 PM - 4:45 PM. Finally settled into class at Ryder Hall. Walked in, sat down, and tried to focus. Just walking, then sitting. 

4:45 PM. I hurried back to Snell Library from Ryder Hall. Passed Subway again.

4:49 PM - 9:21 PM. Back at Snell Library, craving to be back. Just sat down, taking course. I walked to the bathroom, then sat down again. Taking class, then sitting down in Snell Library. I was sitting down patiently, looking at the snow falling. Taking classes, just sitting down. I opened the door, standing, then sat down again. I was sitting down doing homework. I was sitting down to begin an assignment. I walked around in the library.

9:21 PM. I left Snell Library and hurried back to Grove Hall. Passed ilona, Kura Sushi, and ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, then Starbucks and Farmer Horse Coffee, then Ruggles and Caffé Bene. I even saw MIDA, Applebee’s, and Uphams Corner.

9:45 PM - 11:59 PM. Back in Grove Hall. It was quiet, but there was still a loud undercurrent. I was standing, then sitting.
