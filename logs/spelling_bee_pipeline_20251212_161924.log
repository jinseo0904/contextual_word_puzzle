--- GENERATING DIARY (gpt-oss:20b) ---

12:00 AM – 08:27 AM – Stay at Grove Hall (Roxbury)  
I just woke up, feeling the calm hush of campus. The hall was quiet and peaceful, a soft refuge from the day’s hustle. I sat there, letting the morning light filter through the windows, ready to start the day.

08:27 AM – 08:54 AM – Movement from Grove Hall (Roxbury) to Snell Library (Fenway)  
I hopped on my bike and power‑walked to Snell Library, passing the familiar sign of Subway and the bright doorway of Dunkin’. I cycled past the buzzing campus, then settled into a seat, scrolling a bit on my phone as I relaxed before class.

08:54 AM – 09:05 AM – Stay at Snell Library (Fenway)  
It was a rushed, high‑exertion stretch as I hustled to get a good spot in the library. I was getting into standing position, then hurriedly walked toward the class entrance, my footsteps echoing in the quiet stacks.

09:05 AM – 09:07 AM – Movement from Snell Library (Fenway) to Northeastern University (Fenway)  
I hurried through the library corridor, scrolling on my phone and letting the crowds rush past me. I rushed to Northeastern, passing Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, Dunkin’, and Burger 373—each stop a brief splash of color on my route.

09:07 AM – 10:17 AM – Stay at Northeastern University (Fenway)  
The campus buzzed with a loud, noisy environment, yet I found a quiet corner to sit and repeat course material. I settled into my seat, focusing on the lecture notes while the world around me carried on in a bustling rhythm.

10:17 AM – 10:20 AM – Movement back to Snell Library (Fenway)  
I rushed back, watching the crowds as I hurried along the hallway. I passed Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill’s, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, and Chaat House—each a fleeting stop in my sprint.

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM – Stay at Snell Library (Fenway)  
In the quiet of the library, I sat for almost an hour, watching the subtle movements of other students as I concentrated on my reading.

11:09 AM – 11:42 AM – Movement from Snell Library (Fenway) to Amazon Boston (Seaport)  
I ran to the train station, hurriedly writing my subway ticket, then hurried through the station to my friend’s office in Seaport. I sprinted past Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, Dunkin’, Master Wok, Argo Tea, Pink Taco, Auntie Anne’s, the iconic Boston Wharf Co. Sign, Row 34, and Caffé Strega—every place a quick blur in my high‑energy rush.

11:42 AM – 01:51 PM – Stay at Amazon Boston (Seaport)  
I lingered in the lobby, waiting for my friend, while the lobby’s social atmosphere hovered around me. I walked to the bathroom and, as I sat back down, felt my mind shift—an older, steadier version of myself settling in.

01:51 PM – 02:18 PM – Movement from Amazon Boston (Seaport) to Snell Library (Fenway)  
I hurried back to school, scrolling through my phone as I boarded the train. I passed Dunkin’, Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Back Bay, Auntie Anne’s, Back Bay, Caffé Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, and Lolita—each stop a quick snapshot on my rush back to campus.

02:18 PM – 02:48 PM – Stay at Snell Library (Fenway)  
I settled into a quiet seat amidst a buzzing, loud environment, listening to the subtle sounds around me. I sat for a while, watching the people move in and out of the stacks.

02:48 PM – 02:50 PM – Movement from Snell Library (Fenway) to Ryder Hall (Fenway)  
I hurried, scrolling on my phone, and passed the Subway and Dunkin’ spots once more as I made my way to Ryder Hall.

02:50 PM – 04:45 PM – Stay at Ryder Hall (Fenway)  
The hall was a social, quiet space. I walked into my class, took a seat, and kept my phone glued to my screen, distracted but focused on the lecture.

04:45 PM – 04:49 PM – Movement back to Snell Library (Fenway)  
I rushed back to the library, watching the crowds as I hurried along. I passed a single Subway outlet on my way.

04:49 PM – 09:21 PM – Stay at Snell Library (Fenway)  
I finally found a calm spot and sat down, craving the library’s quiet. I studied, took notes, walked to the bathroom when needed, and took another class, all while the library’s quiet and social vibes wrapped around me.

09:21 PM – 09:45 PM – Movement from Snell Library (Fenway) to Grove Hall (Roxbury)  
I walked back, watching the crowds, and passed ilona, Kura Sushi, the ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, Farmer Horse Coffee, Ruggles, Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee’s, and Uphams Corner—each place a fleeting memory in the evening rush.

09:45 PM – 11:59 PM – Stay at Grove Hall (Roxbury)  
The hall’s social atmosphere was loud and bustling, yet the evening carried a quiet calm. I stood, watching the crowds as the night deepened, reflecting on a day full of movement and stillness, of hurried runs and quiet study sessions.

    "contextuality_score": 2,
    "reasoning": "The diary mentions a movement from Ryder Hall to Snell Library at 04:45\u202fPM, so a sign encountered during that trip is a plausible, albeit less direct, source for the word FORT."
