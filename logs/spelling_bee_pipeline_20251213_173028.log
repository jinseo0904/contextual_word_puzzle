--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM - 8:27 AM. Woke up in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet morning, a peaceful start to the day. Just a slow, calm feeling.

8:27 AM. I rushed out of Grove Hall and headed toward Snell Library in Fenway. I cycled, then sat for a moment before heading inside. I passed Dunkin’ and the Subway on the way, grabbing a quick coffee. 

8:54 AM. It was hectic getting into Snell Library, a real push through the crowds. I was already walking to class when I left.

9:05 AM. A quick walk from Snell Library to Northeastern University in Fenway, glued to my screen as usual. I passed Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, more Dunkin’, and Burger 373. So many choices!

9:07 AM - 10:17 AM. Settled down at Northeastern University, trying to repeat some course material. Just sitting, trying to focus, though it was a loud environment.

10:17 AM. Rushed back to Snell Library, passing Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill's, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, and Chaat House. 

10:20 AM - 11:09 AM. Back to sitting at Snell Library, trying to focus again. It was relatively quiet, just the hum of people studying.

11:09 AM. Then a real dash – running to the train station to get to the Seaport. I was writing on my phone, getting directions for the Subway. Passed Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, and Ruggles. Spotted Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, another Dunkin’, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Boston South Station, Auntie Anne’s, and the Boston Wharf Co. Sign. Quite a trek!

11:42 AM - 1:51 PM. Walking to my friend’s office in the Seaport, then just sitting in the lobby waiting. I walked to the bathroom, and something felt… different. My mind felt older, somehow.

1:51 PM. Time to head back to school! I sat on the train, heading back toward Fenway. Passed Dunkin’, Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Boston Back Bay, Boston Back Bay, Auntie Anne’s, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, and even Lolita. 

2:18 PM - 2:48 PM. Back at Snell Library, just sitting and trying to regroup. It was a mix of noise and quiet.

2:48 PM. A quick walk over to Ryder Hall, passing the Subway and Dunkin’ again.

2:50 PM - 4:45 PM. Settled into class at Ryder Hall, then just sitting and taking notes. Walked around a bit during the session.

4:45 PM. Back to Snell Library, walking quickly.

4:49 PM - 9:21 PM. Finally sat down at Snell, craving that library atmosphere. I sat and took classes, walked to the bathroom, and kept working. I've been sitting here, taking classes, taking more classes… Just sitting. I opened the door, standing for a moment, then sat down again. I'm finally doing some homework, working on an assignment, and walking around a bit in the library. 

9:21 PM. Headed back to Grove Hall, passing ilona, Kura Sushi, ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, Farmer Horse Coffee, Ruggles, Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee’s, and finally, Uphams Corner.

9:45 PM - 11:59 PM. Back in Grove Hall, and finally trying to relax. It’s a mix of loud and quiet tonight. ST-Standing.
