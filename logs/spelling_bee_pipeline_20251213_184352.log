--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM - 08:27 AM – Woke up this morning in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet start to the day, a peaceful atmosphere while I gathered myself. 

08:27 AM – Left Grove Hall and hurried towards Snell Library in Fenway. I cycled, then sat for a moment catching my breath. Passed a string of spots like Dunkin' and even spotted the Subway along the way.

08:54 AM – Made it to Snell Library, immediately feeling the pressure – it was a rush just getting inside! I was walking to class, leaving Snell, already feeling the day pick up pace.

09:05 AM – Still rushing, I walked from Snell Library to Northeastern University in Fenway, glued to my screen as I navigated. So many places along the way: Argo Tea, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, another Dunkin', Burger 373… it was a blur. 

09:07 AM – Arrived at Northeastern, sat down to repeat some course material, trying to stay focused even with the loud environment. It was a bit of a social atmosphere, actually.

10:17 AM – Suddenly, I was on the move again, power-walking back to Snell Library. I passed Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, and Churchill's along the way.

10:20 AM – Back at Snell Library, I sat down and finally focused, trying to block out the audible movement around me.

11:09 AM – Another rush! This time I was running to the train station, heading towards Amazon Boston in Seaport. I was writing Subway to go to Seaport. The route was packed with places: Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald's, Melting Sun, another Dunkin', Master Wok, Argo Tea, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Boston South Station, Auntie Anne's, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, Back Bay, Row 34, and Caffé Strega.

11:42 PM – Finally arrived at Amazon Boston in Seaport. I walked to my friend’s office then sat in the lobby waiting. It was a quiet atmosphere, yet I felt like my mind was changing, getting older.

01:51 PM – Time to head back to school. I walked back to school from Seaport, and sat here on the train. I passed Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Boston Back Bay, Boston Back Bay, Auntie Anne's, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, Lolita.

02:18 PM – Back at Snell Library, I settled down and sat for a while.

02:48 PM – A quick move to Ryder Hall in Fenway. I passed a Subway and another Dunkin' on the way.

02:50 PM – Arrived at Ryder Hall and walked into class.

04:45 PM – Class finished, I hurried back to Snell Library. Passed the Subway once more.

04:49 PM – Back at Snell Library, I sat down, craving being back in the library. I sat taking course, walking to the bathroom. I was taking class in the library, sitting down patient in the snow. Now, I'm sitting down doing homework, taking assignments. I’m walking in the library.

09:21 PM – Leaving Snell Library, I headed back to Grove Hall. I passed ilona, Kura Sushi, ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, Farmer Horse Coffee, Ruggles, Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee's, and finally arrived at Uphams Corner. 

09:45 PM – Back in Grove Hall, the atmosphere was a mix of social energy and quiet observation. I just stood, taking it all in.

11:59 PM – And now, finally, it’s time for bed.
