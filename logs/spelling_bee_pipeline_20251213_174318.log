--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM – 8:27 AM. Woke up in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet morning, a peaceful start to the day. Just… settling in. 

8:27 AM. Hurried out of Grove Hall and started power-walking towards Snell Library in Fenway. Passed Dunkin' and a Subway along the way. It was a bustling scene, lots of people already on the move. I was sitting for a moment, catching my breath before heading in. 

8:54 AM. Rushed into Snell Library, needing to get settled for class. It was hectic getting in, a real push to find a spot. I was walking to class, leaving Snell, and passed by Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, and even Burger 373.

9:05 AM. Still rushing, completely distracted by my phone as I walked from Snell Library to Northeastern University in Fenway. I was glued to my screen, barely noticing the sights – though I do remember passing Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, The Boston Globe Library, and even Sweet Tomatoes Pizza again.

9:07 AM – 10:17 AM. Settled down at Northeastern University, trying to repeat course material. It was a loud environment despite my best efforts, a lot of social activity happening around me. I was just sitting, trying to focus.

10:17 AM. Raced back to Snell Library, needing to grab something. Passed Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill's, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, and even Chaat House. 

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM. Back at Snell Library, finally able to sit and focus. Quiet atmosphere, though you could still hear movement around me. Just… sitting.

11:09 AM. A mad dash from Snell Library to Amazon Boston in Seaport. Running to the train station! Writing the Subway to go to Seaport. Walking to my friend’s office, passing Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Dunkin', Master Wok, and even the Boston Wharf Co. Sign.

11:42 PM – 1:51 PM. Finally arrived at Amazon Boston in Seaport. Walking to my friend's office, then just sitting in the lobby, waiting. I was also walking to the bathroom... but it made me feel older somehow. Just sitting for a long while. 

1:51 PM. Headed back to Snell Library from Seaport. A lot of activity on the train. I was sitting there, heading back to school, passing Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, and McDonald’s. Saw Melting Sun, Row 34, and South Station as well, and even Back Bay and Auntie Anne’s.

2:18 PM – 2:48 PM. Back at Snell Library, just sitting. A bit of a loud environment, lots of movement. I was just sitting for a while.

2:48 PM. Quick walk over to Ryder Hall. Passed a Subway and Dunkin’ again, it seems like those are everywhere!

2:50 PM – 4:45 PM. Settled into class at Ryder Hall. Walking into class, then sitting and taking notes. Just... walking and sitting. 

4:45 PM. Raced back to Snell Library. Passed a Subway again, and I was watching the crowds, taking in the sights. 

4:49 PM – 9:21 PM. Back at Snell Library. Really craving being back here. Sat down and took course material. Was walking to the bathroom again, and took class sitting down. I was opening the door standing. I was sitting down doing homework, sitting down to being assignments. The library was filled with activity as I walked in. 

9:21 PM. Leaving Snell Library and heading back to Grove Hall. Passed ilona, Kura Sushi, ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, and Farmer Horse Coffee, then Ruggles, Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee’s, and finally Uphams Corner. 

9:45 PM – 11:59 PM. Back in Grove Hall, finally. Standing for a moment, then settling down. It’s a bit noisy, but mostly quiet.
