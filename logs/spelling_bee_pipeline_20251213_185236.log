--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM – 8:27 AM. Woke up in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet morning, a little bit of a social buzz already stirring. I just felt…still waking up.

8:27 AM – 8:54 AM. Rushed out of Grove Hall and headed towards Snell Library in Fenway. I cycled quickly, weaving past Dunkin’ and the Subway. It was a busy commute, lots of people already out and about. I was sitting for a moment catching my breath when I arrived.

8:54 AM – 9:05 AM. I hurried into Snell Library, practically power-walking to get to class. It was a bit chaotic inside. I'm walking to class leaving Snell Library.

9:05 AM – 9:07 AM. Still rushing, I walked from Snell Library to Northeastern University in Fenway. I was glued to my screen, completely distracted as I passed Argo Tea, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, another Dunkin', Burger 373. 

9:07 AM – 10:17 AM. I sat down in class at Northeastern University, trying to repeat the course material. It was loud with chatter, but I managed to find a quiet spot amidst the social atmosphere. I was just sitting there for a bit.

10:17 AM – 10:20 AM. I rushed back to Snell Library, focused on getting there quickly. I passed Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, and Burger 373 again, and even spotted Churchill's, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes and Chaat House. 

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM. I sat back down at Snell Library, needing to focus. It was quiet, but I could still hear people moving around. I was just sitting, trying to get some work done.

11:09 AM – 11:42 AM. I was running to the train station, determined to get to Seaport. I was writing Subway to go to Seaport, and walking to my friend’s office. I passed Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, and Ruggles, and grabbed a quick bite at Au Bon Pain. Then South Station, McDonald's, Melting Sun, another Dunkin’, Master Wok, and Argo Tea, and Ruggles. Spotted Pink Taco, Boston South Station, Auntie Anne's, and the Boston Wharf Co. Sign. Back Bay and Row 34 were busy. Finally Caffé Strega.

11:42 AM – 1:51 PM. I was walking to my friend’s office in Amazon Boston, Seaport. I was sitting down waiting for my friend in the lobby. Just sitting. Walking to the bathroom. But it changed me. My mind is older.

1:51 PM – 2:18 PM. I was walking back to school from Seaport, rushing to catch the train. I was sitting here on the train, glued to my screen. Passed Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Boston Back Bay, Auntie Anne’s, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, Lolita.

2:18 PM – 2:48 PM. Back at Snell Library, I sat down again, the noise level rising around me. It was a mix of quiet study and audible movement.

2:48 PM – 2:50 PM. I rushed from Snell Library to Ryder Hall, passing the Subway and another Dunkin'.

2:50 PM – 4:45 PM. I walked into class at Ryder Hall and sat down. I was walking around a bit during the lecture, taking notes. 

4:45 PM – 4:49 PM. I rushed back to Snell Library, passing the Subway again.

4:49 PM – 9:21 PM. I craved being back at Snell Library and sat down. I was sitting down taking course. I was walking to the bathroom, then sat down again. Taking class, sitting in the library. Sitting down, patient in the snow. I was sitting down taking classes now, just sitting down. I opened the door standing, then sat back down. I was sitting down doing homework, and working on an assignment. Walking in the library.

9:21 PM – 9:45 PM. I left Snell Library and headed back to Grove Hall, Roxbury. Passed ilona, Kura Sushi, ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks and Farmer Horse Coffee, and Ruggles, then Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee's, and finally Uphams Corner.

9:45 PM – 11:59 PM. Back at Grove Hall, I sat for a bit. Just standing.
