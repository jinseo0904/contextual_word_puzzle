--- GENERATING DIARY (gpt-oss:20b) ---

12:00 AM – 08:27 AM – *Grove Hall (Roxbury)*  
I just woke up. The dorm corridors felt peaceful, the only sound a distant hum of the building’s HVAC. I sat on the edge of my bed, breathing in the calm, and let the morning quiet settle around me.

08:27 AM – 08:54 AM – *Grove Hall (Roxbury) → Snell Library (Fenway)*  
I left Grove Hall and walked through the campus courtyard, past a Subway kiosk and a Dunkin’ sign that flickered like a neon beacon. The walk felt relaxed, a gentle transition from sleep to activity.

08:54 AM – 09:05 AM – *Snell Library (Fenway)*  
It was getting into Library standing. I was rushing, my shoulders hunched as I hurried to catch my first class. The library’s quiet felt oddly urgent, every footstep echoing louder in the empty stacks.

09:05 AM – 09:07 AM – *Snell Library (Fenway) → Northeastern University (Fenway)*  
I hurried out of the library, glued to my phone as I scrolled through emails. The corridor was bustling, the air thick with the chatter of classmates. I passed Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, Dunkin’, and Burger 373—each stop a quick, almost imperceptible pause.

09:07 AM – 10:17 AM – *Northeastern University (Fenway)*  
The classroom was noisy yet surprisingly calm. I sat, repeating course material, feeling the gentle rhythm of lecture slides against a backdrop of low chatter and distant footsteps. My phone lay in my pocket, the screen a quiet, muted presence.

10:17 AM – 10:20 AM – *Northeastern University (Fenway) → Snell Library (Fenway)*  
I power-walked back to the library, people‑watching as I passed Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill’s, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, and Chaat House. The corridor buzzed with hurried footsteps, a mosaic of hurried lives.

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM – *Snell Library (Fenway)*  
Back in the stacks, the atmosphere was quiet, but the hum of distant students made it feel alive. I sat, focusing on my notes, the air a gentle, almost meditative calm.

11:09 AM – 11:42 AM – *Snell Library (Fenway) → Amazon Boston (Seaport)*  
I ran to the train station, my heartbeat quickening. I sprinted past Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, Dunkin’, Master Wok, Argo Tea, Pink Taco, Auntie Anne’s, the Boston Wharf Co. Sign, Row 34, and Caffé Strega—each stop a fleeting, bright blur as I chased the platform.

11:42 AM – 01:51 PM – *Amazon Boston (Seaport)*  
The lobby felt quiet, a calm bubble amidst the surrounding bustle. I waited for my friend, sat down, and then walked to the bathroom. A strange calm settled over me; my mind felt older, a quiet shift in perspective.

01:51 PM – 02:18 PM – *Amazon Boston (Seaport) → Snell Library (Fenway)*  
I hurried back to campus, the train platform loud and chaotic. I passed Dunkin’, Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald’s, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Back Bay, Auntie Anne’s, Back Bay again, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, the Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, and Lolita—each name flashing like a neon sign as I rushed through the maze of cafés and eateries.

02:18 PM – 02:48 PM – *Snell Library (Fenway)*  
Back in the library’s quiet corners, the environment was calm yet slightly noisy with the distant hum of study groups. I sat, my focus sharp, listening to the soft rustle of pages.

02:48 PM – 02:50 PM – *Snell Library (Fenway) → Ryder Hall (Fenway)*  
I rushed to Ryder Hall, passing Subway and Dunkin’ again—small, familiar stops that felt like punctuation in my hurried journey.

02:50 PM – 04:45 PM – *Ryder Hall (Fenway)*  
Inside Ryder Hall, I walked into the class, sitting and scrolling through my phone, the screen a constant, glued presence. The room was quiet but social, classmates murmuring in their own bubbles of thought.

04:45 PM – 04:49 PM – *Ryder Hall (Fenway) → Snell Library (Fenway)*  
I hurried back to the library, watching the commuters crowd the subway exit. The corridor was bustling, people‑watching a living snapshot of campus life.

04:49 PM – 09:21 PM – *Snell Library (Fenway)*  
The library remained a haven of quiet, a calm space where I sat and worked. The hours slipped by in a steady rhythm of study and intermittent glances at the clock.

09:21 PM – 09:45 PM – *Snell Library (Fenway) → Grove Hall (Roxbury)*  
I walked back toward Grove Hall, people‑watching as I passed ilona, Kura Sushi, the ISEC Pedestrian Bridge, Starbucks, Farmer Horse Coffee, Ruggles, Caffé Bene, MIDA, Applebee’s, and Uphams Corner—each stop a vivid tile in the mosaic of the evening.

09:45 PM – 11:59 PM – *Grove Hall (Roxbury)*  
Back at Grove Hall, the environment felt loud and yet oddly calm. I stood, my body relaxed, listening to the night’s chatter while the hall’s bustle settled into a quiet hum. The day’s journey, full of rushed steps, people‑watching pauses, and moments of calm focus, had come full circle.
