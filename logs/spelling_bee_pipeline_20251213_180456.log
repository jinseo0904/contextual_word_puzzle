--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM – 8:27 AM. Woke up in Grove Hall, Roxbury. It was a quiet morning, a little bit of a social atmosphere too. Just easing into the day.

8:27 AM. Rushed out of Grove Hall and headed towards Snell Library in Fenway. I cycled, then sat for a moment catching my breath. Passed a string of places – Subway, and of course, a Dunkin’. 

8:54 AM. Got into Snell Library, feeling the pressure already. I was walking to class, leaving Snell. The library was bustling.

9:05 AM. Hurried from Snell Library to Northeastern University, also in Fenway. I was glued to my screen, distracted, and trying to get there quickly. So many spots around - Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, even the Boston Globe Library, Dunkin', and Burger 373.

9:07 AM – 10:17 AM. Settled down at Northeastern University, repeating course material. It was loud, but a strange mix of social and quiet. I was just sitting there.

10:17 AM. Power-walked back to Snell Library. Passed Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill's, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes, and Chaat House along the way.

10:20 AM – 11:09 AM. Back at Snell Library, just sitting, trying to focus. It was quiet, with just the audible movement of other students.

11:09 AM. Raced out of Snell Library, running to the train station to get to Seaport. I was writing to confirm Subway plans. So many places blurred by – Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald's, Boston Back Bay, Melting Sun, Dunkin', Master Wok, Argo Tea, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Boston South Station, Auntie Anne’s, the Boston Wharf Co. Sign, Back Bay, Row 34, and Caffé Strega.

11:42 AM – 1:51 PM. Arrived at Amazon Boston in Seaport, walking to my friend's office. Settled into the lobby, then sat, waiting for her. Just sitting there, but my mind felt…older. I walked to the bathroom briefly.

1:51 PM. Hurried back towards school, leaving Amazon Boston. I was sitting on the train, heading back to Snell Library. Passed Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Boston Back Bay, Boston Back Bay, Auntie Anne's, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co.

2:18 PM – 2:48 PM. Back at Snell Library, just sitting. A mix of quiet and social energy, with the audible movement of people and the general noise.

2:48 PM. Power-walked over to Ryder Hall, also in Fenway, passing Subway and Dunkin'.

2:50 PM – 4:45 PM. Walked into class at Ryder Hall, then sat. Was walking around during class. It was distracted, but a quiet atmosphere with a little bit of social energy.

4:45 PM. Rushed back to Snell Library, passing the Subway.

4:49 PM – 9:21 PM. Back at Snell Library, craving to be back. Just sat down, taking courses. Walked to the bathroom. Sat down taking class. Sat down taking class in the library. Sat down patient taking class in the snow. Sat down taking classes now. Sitting down taking classes. Opening the door standing. Sat down. Sat down doing homework. Sat down assigning. Walking in the library.
