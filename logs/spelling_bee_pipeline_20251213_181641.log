--- GENERATING DIARY (gemma3:27b) ---

12:00 AM - 8:27 AM. Woke up in Grove Hall (Roxbury). It was a quiet morning, a peaceful start to the day. Just a still, social atmosphere.

8:27 AM. Rushed out of Grove Hall (Roxbury) and headed towards Snell Library (Fenway), cycling quickly. I passed Dunkin' and the Subway along the way. It was a bit of a power-walk to get there, sitting briefly before continuing on.

8:54 AM. Got into Snell Library (Fenway) – it was hectic, a real rush. I was already walking to class as I left. 

9:05 AM. Still rushing, leaving Snell Library (Fenway) and heading toward Northeastern University (Fenway). I was glued to my screen, distracted as I walked, passing Argo Tea, Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, The Boston Globe Library, another Dunkin', and Burger 373.

9:07 AM - 10:17 AM. Settled down at Northeastern University (Fenway). It was a loud environment, a mix of social and quiet corners as I sat repeating course material. 

10:17 AM. Rushed back from Northeastern University (Fenway) to Snell Library (Fenway), noticing Sweet Tomatoes Pizza, Tu Taco, Argo Tea, Burger 373, Churchill’s, Kigo Kitchen, Popeyes and Chaat House along the way.

10:20 AM - 11:09 AM. Back at Snell Library (Fenway), just sitting and focusing. A peaceful, quiet spot amidst the audible movement around me.

11:09 AM. A quick rush from Snell Library (Fenway) towards Amazon Boston (Seaport). I was running to the train station, then writing on the Subway, heading to Seaport. I passed Boston South Station, Boston Back Bay, Ruggles, Au Bon Pain, South Station, McDonald's, Boston Back Bay, Melting Sun, another Dunkin', Master Wok, Argo Tea, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Boston South Station, Auntie Anne's, the Boston Wharf Co. Sign, Back Bay, Row 34, and Caffé Strega.

11:42 PM - 1:51 PM. Arrived at Amazon Boston (Seaport), walking to my friend’s office and then sitting in the lobby waiting. It was a social but also quiet atmosphere. I even walked to the bathroom, thinking how my mind felt older.

1:51 PM. Started walking back to school from Amazon Boston (Seaport). I was sitting on the train when I realized I was headed back. We passed Dunkin', Au Bon Pain, Boston South Station, Master Wok, Ruggles, Pink Taco, Massachusetts Avenue, McDonald's, Melting Sun, Row 34, South Station, Boston Back Bay, Boston Back Bay, Auntie Anne's, Back Bay, Boston South Station, Caffè Nero, Sportello, Ruggles, Boston Wharf Co. Sign, La Colombe Coffee Roasters, and Lolita.

2:18 PM - 2:48 PM. Back at Snell Library (Fenway), just sitting again, surrounded by noise.

2:48 PM. A quick rush from Snell Library (Fenway) to Ryder Hall (Fenway), passing the Subway and another Dunkin’.

2:50 PM - 4:45 PM. At Ryder Hall (Fenway), walking into class, then sitting down and taking notes. 

4:45 PM. Rushed back from Ryder Hall (Fenway) to Snell Library (Fenway), passing the Subway again.

4:49 PM - 9:21 PM. Settled back into Snell Library (Fenway), craving the quiet space. I sat taking classes, walking to the bathroom, and working on assignments. I was just sitting, and then sitting again.
