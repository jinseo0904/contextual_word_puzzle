I have a list of generated clues. Many of them are grammatically awkward, use words incorrectly, or sound like a robot wrote them.

Your Task:
Filter this JSON list. Keep ONLY the clues that meet these criteria:
1. **Idiomatic:** The sentence sounds like something a native English speaker would actually say.
2. **Grammatically Perfect:** No misuse of adjectives/verbs (e.g., "You were not utter").
3. **Logically Sound:** No bizarre metaphors (e.g., "The campus was a comfortable terry").

If a clue is "Direct" (based on a location or action), prioritize keeping it.
If a clue is "Metaphorical" or "Thematic," be VERY skeptical. Discard it if it is vague.

**Input JSON:**

**Output:**
Return a JSON list of ONLY the valid, high-quality clues. Do not rewrite them, just select the good ones.
