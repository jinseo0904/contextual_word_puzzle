### INSTRUCTIONS
For EACH word in the "Target Word List", generate a single sentence clue. The target word must be the answer to the blank (represented by "_______") in the sentence.

Because the words are constraints of the game, they may not all relate directly to the user's day. You must use one of the following **Bridge Strategies** to connect the word to the narrative without making up fake events:

1. **Direct:** The word or a synonym describes an actual event, location, or object in the narrative.
   * *Example:* Narrative says user ran. Word: FAST. -> "You were moving _______ during your 2 PM jog."
2. **Thematic/Vibe:** The word relates to the *feeling* or *state* of the data (HR, stress, speed).
   * *Example:* Narrative says HR was low. Word: PEACE. -> "Your heart rate suggests you were at _______ while reading in the park."
3. **Contrast/Negative:** The word describes what the user did *not* do, or is the opposite of the environment.
   * *Example:* Narrative says user was in a loud city. Word: SILENCE. -> "There was very little _______ to be found during your walk through Times Square."
4. **Metaphorical:** A loose association based on the data.
   * *Example:* Narrative says user zig-zagged on a map. Word: SNAKE. -> "Your GPS trace looked like a _______ winding through the streets."

### RULES (Strict Adherence Required)
1. **NO BS:** Do not invent physical objects or events not in the summary. If the word is "TIGER" and the user went to the gym, do NOT say "You saw a tiger at the gym." Instead, use a metaphor ("You unleashed your inner _______") or contrast ("You were certainly not as stealthy as a _______ on the treadmill").
2. **Clarity:** The clue must be grammatically correct.
3. **Format:** Output a JSON object.
