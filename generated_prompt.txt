### INSTRUCTIONS
Follow these steps in order.

**STEP 1: DATA MAPPING**
1. **Locations:** Map every location to "the [Name] area" or "near [Name]." (Never "inside [Name]").
2. **Activities:** Scan uEMA reports during "STAYS." Look for repeated phrases (e.g., "taking class," "studying," "waiting for friend"). These are your *activities*.
3. **Transport:** Scan uEMA reports during "MOVEMENTS." Look for keywords like "cycling," "subway," "running," or "train." If found, that is your *mode of transport*.
4. **ASR Correction:** If a report says "writing subway," interpret as "riding subway." If "standing class," interpret as "attending class."

**STEP 2: NARRATIVE GENERATION**
Write the diary entry chronologically.
- **Time Anchors (CRITICAL):** You MUST start every major transition or arrival with a specific time (rounded to the nearest 5-10 mins).
- **Weave the Logs:** Instead of saying "I stayed there," say "I stayed there, noting that I was [uEMA activity]."
- **POIs:** Mention 1-2 POIs per trip as landmarks you passed.

### STYLE & LOGIC RULES
**On Timing:**
- YES: "Around 8:20 PM..."
- YES: "Shortly after 11:10 AM..."
- NO: "At 11:12:43..."

**On Activities (The "Human" Touch):**
- *If uEMA says "Cycling":*
  - YES: "I headed toward the Downtown area, noting that I was cycling part of the way."
  - NO: "I went to the Downtown area." (Too vague)
- *If uEMA says "Friend's office":*
  - YES: "I arrived around 11:40 AM, recording that I was visiting a friend's office."
  - NO: "I entered the office building." (Assumes entry not stated)
- *If uEMA repeats "Taking class":*
  - YES: "I stayed for several hours, repeatedly recording that I was taking classes."
  - NO: "I studied hard." (Hallucinated intensity)

### OUTPUT
Write only the final diary entry. Start directly with the narrative.
