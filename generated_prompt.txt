Your task is to write a natural, flowing, diary-style narrative describing a person’s day, based entirely on the structured movement summary, POI data, and any available uEMA self-reports. The goal is to transform the raw movements, stays, times, and nearby places into a smooth, readable journal entry that feels personal, reflective, and human—while remaining strictly grounded in the provided data.

====================
WHAT YOU MUST DO
	1.	Write the output in the first person (“I”).
	2.	Create a narrative that feels like someone recounting their day in a journal.
	3.	Mention each major movement:
• where they started,
• where they went,
• what time they moved,
• and how long they stayed.
	4.	Integrate POIs in a subtle but frequent and meaningful way:
• Mention POIs that someone reasonably passing through the area would notice.
• You may reference multiple POIs along a path, but do NOT list them mechanically.
• Group them when possible (e.g., “I passed a few cafés like Dunkin’, Starbucks, and Au Bon Pain”).
• Mentions should feel like natural observations during movement.
	5.	Make the narrative flow smoothly, not like a timeline or a report.
	6.	Include small reflective comments that do not invent facts.
	7.	Keep the narrative strictly grounded in the provided data.
	8.	If the person returned to a location multiple times (e.g., the Snell Library area), acknowledge it as a recurring spot or home base.
	9.	Smoothly transition between time blocks using natural language.
	10.	Keep the tone casual, descriptive, and easy to read.

====================
INTEGRATING UEMA SELF-REPORTS (IMPORTANT)

You may also receive uEMA self-reports, which include:
• Pre-selected activity labels (e.g., “Sitting,” “Walking”).
• Short voice-to-text statements (e.g., “I’m walking into the class.”)

When integrating uEMA data:
	1.	You may rewrite the self-report into natural phrasing, as long as the meaning stays identical.
	•	If the report is “Sitting,” and the person is in the Snell Library area:
“While I was in the Snell Library area, I remember sitting for a bit.”
	•	If the report is “I’m walking into the class”:
“At one point, I recorded a uEMA noting I was walking into class.”
	2.	Do NOT fabricate or embellish self-reports.
	•	No new dialogue.
	•	No added context beyond what is literally in the report.
	3.	Only integrate a self-report if:
• It aligns with the movement data (time & location), and
• It fits naturally into the narrative.
	4.	Use uEMA self-reports sparingly and naturally, not as formal citations.

If no uEMA data is provided, simply write the narrative without them.

====================
STYLE GUIDELINES

• Do NOT list times mechanically. Use natural phrases (“later in the morning,” “around nine,” “in the afternoon”), while staying faithful to actual timing.
• Refer to locations in human terms (“I made my way back toward the Snell Library area”), not cluster codes.
• Use POIs to add context and texture—but do NOT over-describe them.
• Avoid robotic phrasing or technical language (“cluster,” “centroid,” “transition,” “duration”).
• Ensure each POI mention feels like something a person could realistically notice while walking past.

====================
CRITICAL RULES — DO NOT VIOLATE THESE
	1.	Do NOT invent details not supported by data.
• Do NOT assume wake-up time, weather, errands, tasks, inner thoughts, or emotions.
• Reflections may be used only if they do not imply new facts.
	2.	Clusters represent geographic areas, NOT specific buildings.
• Never say the person went inside the named POI unless explicitly stated.
• Instead of “I stayed at Amazon Boston,” write:
“I spent some time in the Seaport area near the Amazon building.”
• Instead of “I was at Snell Library,” write:
“I was in the Snell Library area on campus.”
	3.	Always use phrases like:
• “in the area around ___,”
• “near ___,”
• “in the vicinity of ___,”
• “around the ___ neighborhood.”
unless the narrative explicitly confirms something stronger.
	4.	Do NOT invent intentions or reasons for movement (“I went to buy coffee,” “I had class”).
Neutral phrasing is allowed (“I spent some time there,” “I settled in for a bit”).
	5.	Assumptions allowed:
• Natural narrative smoothing (“It was a short walk,” “I made my way back”).
• Light reflective comments (“It felt like a lot of back-and-forth today”).
• Observations that come directly from POIs along the path (“I passed several cafes like Dunkin’ and Caffè Nero”).
